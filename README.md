## Summary

- **Architecture**: Contains the network design and advanced cryptographic mechanisms, including the use of **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZK-Proofs)**, that enhance privacy and scalability.
  
- **Consensus**: Explains the **PoSyg consensus** mechanism, how **rewards and penalties** are applied, and the measures taken to **prevent attacks** on the network.
  
- **Economics**: Details the **staking** incentives, the **tokenomics** of SynLedger, and strategies to control **volatility** within the blockchain ecosystem.
  
- **Whitepapers**: Includes the core technical whitepapers covering the formal verification, mathematical proofs, and performance analyses of the SynLedger and PoSyg consensus.

## Usage

This repository is intended for developers, researchers, and early adopters who are interested in the technical underpinnings of **SynLedger**. The documents provide the necessary insights to contribute to, participate in, or simply understand the project.
