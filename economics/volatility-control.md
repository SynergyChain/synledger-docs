# Volatility Control in SynLedger

SynLedger incorporates multiple mechanisms to maintain price stability and prevent excessive volatility. These mechanisms focus on balancing token supply and demand while ensuring a sustainable reward structure.

## 1. **Dynamic Token Supply**

SynLedger adjusts its token supply dynamically in response to market conditions, preventing large price swings and reducing speculative risks.

- **Token Burning**: Excess tokens can be burned to reduce supply during periods of high inflation or volatility.
- **Supply Increase**: Conversely, during times of high network activity and demand, the supply can be increased, but only in proportion to the network's synergy.

## 2. **Synergy and Supply Management**

The concept of synergy is directly linked to supply control. As the network's collective synergy increases, the system can afford to release more tokens without triggering inflationary pressure.

## 3. **Controlling Market Volatility**

By monitoring both external market conditions and internal network metrics, SynLedger can automatically trigger supply adjustments, maintaining a healthy balance between stability and growth. The integration of these volatility control mechanisms makes SynLedger more resilient to external shocks, ensuring long-term value retention for participants.
