# Staking in SynLedger

Staking is at the heart of SynLedgerâ€™s security and consensus model. It allows participants to lock their tokens, actively securing the network, while earning rewards based on their synergy and behavior.

## 1. **Staking Overview**

Participants in SynLedger stake their tokens to contribute to the consensus process. By doing so, they take part in validating transactions and maintaining the integrity of the network.

## 2. **Staking Rewards**

Staking rewards in SynLedger are determined by two main factors: 
- **Synergy**: High-synergy participants earn a higher portion of the rewards.
- **Behavior**: Honest participants are rewarded, while dishonest ones face penalties.

### How Synergy Affects Staking:
- Synergy acts as a multiplier on staking rewards. The higher a participant's synergy, the more rewards they receive, encouraging long-term commitment and good behavior.

## 3. **Penalties for Dishonest Behavior**

Participants engaging in dishonest behavior face penalties that reduce their staked tokens and synergy. Severe and repeated offenses lead to heavier penalties, ensuring network security.

## 4. **Staking as a Governance Tool**

In addition to securing the network, staking in SynLedger also grants governance rights to participants. High-synergy stakers have more influence in governance, aligning network security with decision-making power.
